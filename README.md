# Treasure_iOS
An example app that demonstrates various MapKit features. Try to find the treasure! 

The app should build without issue in Xcode 9.x - simply clone or download the repo and open the Xcode project. The original presentation is included in the project at [`./MapKit-presentation.pdf`](./MapKit-presentation.pdf).

## Features
* Custom map styling (via OpenStreetMap tiles)
* Custom annotation images
* Annotation clustering (via MapKit)
* Walking directions between annotations (to use, simply tap two or more annotations; a route between them will appear on the map)
